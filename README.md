# OpenCL
 Research Project Summer 2022

This is an OpenCL FPGA kernel that runs a Multi-state Pushdown Transducer based finite state machine.
The finite state machine operates a run Length Encoding Algorithm.
More efficient copression and decompression is accomploished in this way, turning the FPGA into a configurable hardware accelerator.
